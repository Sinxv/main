                    Once you reach level 99, you will unlock "Elrianode", and the 2nd guide of the "Dr.Pho's Guide", found in the middle top of your screen, your main objective on this stage, is to fully complete the first 2 Dr.Pho's Guides.
                    
                    <h2>Elrianode Armor</h2>
                    On <span id="HIGHLIGHTEDTEXT">Dr. Pho's 2nd Guide, Lesson 1</span>, you'll notice that the first mission is to <span id="QUESTCOLOR">Clear 3 Elrianode Region Dungeons</span>, once you finish that, you will be able to claim the Restored Elrianode Armor and a 30 days Elrios Guardian Knights IB Accessories Set.<br>
                    Both armor and IBs are really good for early game, since alongside your weapon, theyre a main source of Combat Power.<br><br> Be careful though, since the IB Accessories are temporal you'll need to save 550m~ ED to get 5500 EP Points, or alternatively, you could level up the same character multiple times, to get the accessories (Transferable via Luriel Bank), since every character gets more than 1000 EP from lv 1 to lv 99<br>
                    <h2>Apocalypse-Type Weapon</h2>
                    Once you acquire the Restored Elrianode Armor you will notice that your weapon is not good anymore, since it's old by this point, so you will need to spam the "Add's Theory Dungeon" until you get the Apocalypse-Type Weapon Cube.
                    <p id="guidenotice">Notice that since the drop is RNG, this can drop the very first run or 10 runs, but is highly unlikely that it takes long. Also, you can upgrade the weapon to +10 Via Dr. Pho's 2nd Guide 16 Quests Cleared Prize *</p>
                    Using this cube will give you a new weapon, which will be way stronger than the one you had previously.
                    <h2>Socketing</h2>
                    Your Armor and Weapon has something called "Sockets", which are empty when you get them. you can use Magic Stones for socket by pressing Inventory -> Magic Stone Enchant.<br> 
                    There are different tiers of <i>normal</i> magic stones:<br><br>

                    <p id="guidenotice">It's highly recommended to keep your Sage's Magic Stones, as they are rare, instead, use your Refined Magic Stones to socket Elrianode Armor and Apocalypse-Type Weapon, as they are highly gifted throughout the Dr.Pho's Guide *</p>
                    The stats you should socket are Maximize % and Critical %, if you get Critical or Maximize on 1 slot but all other slots are wrong, click the blue square to lock the slot and Click "Auto-Equip" to reroll all unlocked socket slots.
                    <br>It's fine if you get low values on armor, instead search high values on weapon.<br>
                    <h3>Wedges</h3>
                    Wedges are items that allow you to increase the max sockets of an armor or weapon by 1, "Ancient Guardian Wedge" is used for Armor, and "Ancient Iron Wedge" is used for Weapon. they can be crafted via Glave NPC with resources you get on Heroic Dungeon.<br>
                    Heroic Dungeon is located in the Special Section of Dungeon List, {Include mention to Dr. Pho's lesson when i remember what lesson it was}, lets you recieve Wedges after doing Heroic Dungeon 2 times, so make sure to do them.
