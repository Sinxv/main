                    Once you reach level 99, you will unlock "Elrianode", and the 2nd guide of the "Dr.Pho's Guide", found in the middle top of your screen, your main objective on this stage, is to fully complete the first 2 Dr.Pho's Guides.
                    
                    <h2>Elrianode Armor</h2>
                    First step, is to do "Hall of El" 3 times, once you finish that, you will be able to claim the "Restored Elrianode Armor" on Dr Pho's Guide.<br>
                    This armor is really good for early game, since alongside your weapon, is a main source of Combat Power.<br>
                    <h2>Apocalypse-Type Weapon</h2>
                    After equiping the Elrianode Armor you will notice that your weapon is not good anymore, since it's old by this point, so you will need to spam the "Add's Theory Dungeon" until you get the Apocalypse-Type Weapon Cube.<br>
                    Using this cube will give you a new weapon, which will be way stronger than the one you had previously.<br>
                    <h2>Socketing</h2>
                    Your Armor and Weapon has something called Socket, which are empty right now. you can use Magic Stones for socket by pressing Inventory -> I forgot how was this called.<br> 
                    There are green ones: "I forgot" and red ones: "I forgot again", which are the easiest to get, then Blue ones: "Temp because i somehow forgot", that are decent and highly gifted on the Dr. Pho's Guide, you should use these ones to socket in your armor and weapon.
                    <br>The stats you should search to socket, are Maximize % and Critical %, if you get Critical or Maximize on 1 slot but all other slots are wrong, click the blue square to lock the slot and Click "Auto-Equip" to reroll all unlocked socket slots.
                    <br>It's fine if you get low values on armor, instead search high values on weapon.<br><br>
                    Now, you will need to do Heroic Dungeon Twice, as this gives you "I once again FORGOT HOW IS IT CALLED OH MY GOD" that increase your max sockets by 1 (Can only be applied once per piece, max 4 sockets for armor, and 6 for weapon).
