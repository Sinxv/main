                    Once you finish character creation and tutorial, Press F8 or click "Start Dungeon" button, you'll be greeted by a list of regions; 
                    Your main task is to complete the first dungeon "Tree of El" (Dungeon is different for Lithia, Noah and Laby)
                    to recieve rewards:<br>

                    <img height="64px">
                    <span class="titlename">Growing Adventurer's Equipment Cube</span><br>
                    This cube gives the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Growing Adventurer's Top Piece</li>
                        <li>Growing Adventurer's Bottom Piece</li>
                        <li>Growing Adventurer's Gloves</li>
                        <li>Growing Adventurer's Shoes</li>
                        <li>Growing Adventurer's Weapon</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    this is the equipment you will use for the entirety of the leveling up section, as its a weapon that grows alongside his owner and is the strongest you can get.<br>
                    <br>Now, you need to do the dungeons that your main quest (the yellow one) asks you to do.<br> 
                    On level 15 you will get a pet called "Phoru", this pet auto collects all drops, which is essential in order to get some headstart money, activate him on Inventory -> Special, also you will get the "First class promotion quest" where you will be able to choose the path of a character, you can complete this just by following the main quests, as you will still enter all the dungeons that the promotion quest asks for, then on level 40, and level 70 you will get promotions that will give passives and new skills to your character<br>
                    <br>It's recommended to choose a path that is able to support, as they are priority on game content later on *
                    <br>
                    Everytime you complete a class promotion, you get a "useful items" box, you need to open them in order to get an EXP increase medal. 
                    <br><br>There's nothing else to take in account before level 99 so now the only thing you need to do, is just complete your main quests till you level up to 99, but keep in mind that if you dont have the EXP medal, you won't level up to 99 with the last dungeon.
